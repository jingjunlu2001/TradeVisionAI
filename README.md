# TradeVisionAI

1. Project Overview: 
This project aims to build a real-time trading data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes financial market data to generate AI-driven trading recommendations. The system will be developed locally first and later migrated to AWS for production deployment.
2. System Architecture: 
Development Phase (Local Execution)
Stream Processing: Apache Kafka (running locally)
ETL Processing: Apache Spark (running locally)
Storage: AWS S3 (used for storing processed data and AI model artifacts)
AI Model: TensorFlow LSTM (trained locally)
Deployment: Local Docker-based setup for model inference and APIs
Production Phase (AWS Migration)
Stream Processing: Apache Kafka on AWS MSK (future migration)
ETL Processing: Apache Spark on AWS EMR (future migration)
Storage: AWS S3
AI Model Training: Future migration to AWS SageMaker
Deployment: Dockerized application running on AWS EC2
3. Technology Stack: 
Cloud Platform: AWS (for storage & future deployment)
Stream Processing: Apache Kafka (Local -> AWS MSK in production)
ETL Tool: Apache Spark (Local -> AWS EMR in production)
Storage: AWS S3 (for storing trading data and AI models)
AI Model: TensorFlow LSTM for time-series forecasting
Model Serving: FastAPI (Local Docker -> AWS EC2 in production)
Orchestration (Future): Apache Airflow (for automated ETL & model training workflows)
4. Implementation Plan: 
Phase 1: Local Development
Phase 2: Migration to AWS
5. Data Pipeline Workflow: 
Ingestion: Kafka streams real-time trading data from API (Alpha Vantage: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)
Processing: Spark ETL processes streamed data and stores it in AWS S3
AI Model Training: LSTM model trains on historical trading data stored in S3
Inference: FastAPI-based service predicts trends and recommends trading actions
Deployment: Model is served via Docker (locally, then on AWS EC2 in production)
6. Cost Optimization Strategies: 
Running Kafka and Spark locally during development to save AWS costs
Using AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering for optimized storage
Training AI models locally before migrating to AWS SageMaker
Using EC2 Spot Instances for cost-effective model deployment in production
7. Expected Outcomes: 
A functional real-time trading data pipeline
A trained LSTM-based AI model for trend prediction
A Dockerized AI inference API
A cost-optimized, scalable architecture ready for cloud migration
